.SH DESCRIPTION
Linux x86-64 kernels since 2.6.4 don't print recoverable machine check errors
to the kernel log anymore. Instead they are saved into a special 
kernel buffer accessible using
.I /dev/mcelog.
mcelog reads /dev/mcelog and prints the stored machine check records
to stdout. Then the stored machine check records in the kernel
buffer are deleted.

Mcelog normally runs as a regular cron job to log kernel machine check
events to disk. On newer kernels it can also be triggered directly
using the 
.I /sys/devices/system/machinecheck/machinecheck0/trigger
trigger.
In addition mcelog can be used on the command line to decode an existing machine 
check record in ascii format with the 
.I \-\-ascii
option.

When the 
.B \-\-syslog
option is specified redirect output to system log. The 
.B \-\-syslog-error
option causes the errors to be logged as 
.I LOG_ERR.
Some one line summies of errors are also always logged to the syslog.

When
.B \-\-k8
is specified assume the events are for a AMD Opteron or Athlon 64 or Athlon
FX CPU. 
With
.B \-\-p4
is specified assume the events are for a Intel Pentium 4 or Intel (older) Xeon.
With 
.B \-\-core2
assume the events are for a Intel Core2 CPU or Intel Xeon 3000, 3200, 5100, 5300, 7300 
series. When
.B \-\-intel-cpu=family,model
are specified then the family number and model number of the Intel CPU
to be decoded should be specified (can be found in /proc/cpuinfo).
When 
.B \-\-generic 
all the fields are dumped without CPU specific decoding.
Default is to decode for the CPU mcelog is running on.

With the
.B \-\-dmi
option mcelog will look up the addresses reported in machine
checks in the 
.I SMBIOS/DMI
tables of the BIOS.
This can sometimes tell you which DIMM or memory controller
has developed a problem. More often the information reported
by the BIOS is either subtly or obviously wrong or useless.
This option requires that mcelog has read access to /dev/mem
(normally requires root) and runs on the same machine
in the same hardware configuration as when the machine check
event happened.

When 
.B \-\-ignorenodev
is specified then mcelog will exit silently when the device
cannot be opened. This is useful in virtualized environment
with limited devices.

When 
.B \-\-filter
is specified 
.I mcelog
will filter out known broken machine check events.

When 
.B \-\-raw
is specified
.I mcelog
will not decode, but just dump the mcelog in a raw hex format. This
can be useful for automatic post processing.

When a device is specified the machine check logs are read from
device instead of the default
.I /dev/mcelog.

With the 
.B \-\-ascii
option mcelog decodes a fatal machine check panic generated
by the kernel ("CPU n: Machine Check Exception ...") in ASCII from stdout.
This is useful to make sense of the hexadecimal numbers in there.
Note that when the panic comes from a different machine than 
where mcelog is running on you might need to specify the correct
architecture (
.I \-\-k8
or
.I \-\-p4 
or 
.I \-\-core2
).

With the
.B \-\-daemon
option mcelog will run in the background and continuously poll
for machine checks for the kernel. This gives the fastest reaction
time, but the normal recommended operating mode is running
as a cronjob or from the kernel trigger (through
.I /sys/devices/system/machinecheck/machinecheck0/trigger). 
This option implies 
.I \-\-syslog.

.B \-\-database filename
specifies the memory module error database file. Default is
/var/lib/memory-errors.  It is only used together with DMI decoding.


.B \-\-error\-trigger=cmd,thresh
When a memory module accumulates 
.I thresh
errors in the err database run command 
.I cmd. 

.B \-\-drop-old-memory
Drop old DIMMs in the memory module database that are not plugged in
anymore.

.B \-\-reset\-memory=locator
When the DIMMs have suitable unique serial numbers mcelog
will automatically detect changed DIMMs. When the DIMMs don't
have those the user will have to use this option when changing
a DIMM to reset the error count in the error database.
.I Locator 
is the memory slot identifier printed on the motherboard.

.B \-\-dump-memory[=locator]
Dump error database information for memory module located
at 
.I locator.
When no locator is specified dump all.

.B \-\-version
displays the version of mcelog and exits.
.SH NOTES
The kernel prefers old messages over new. If the log buffer overflows
only old ones will be kept.

The exact output depends on the CPU.

SMBIOS/DMI output is unreliable and sometimes wrong. Not Linux's
fault - complain to your motherboard vendor. mcelog does some sanity
checks to distingush bad BIOS from good BIOS but it is not 100% 
fool proof.

mcelog will report serious errors to the syslog during decoding.
