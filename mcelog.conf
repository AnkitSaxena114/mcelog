#
# Example config file for mcelog
# mcelog is the user space backend that decodes and process machine check events
# (cpu hardware errors) reported by the CPU to the kernel
#

# general format
# optionname = value
# white space is not allowed in value currently, except at the end where it is dropped
#

# in general all command line options that are not commands work here
# see man mcelog or mcelog --help for a list
# e.g. to enable the --no-syslog option use 
# no-syslog = yes   (or no to disable)
# when the option has a argument
# logfile = /tmp/logfile

# Set CPU type for which mcelog decodes events:
# cpu = type
# valid values: k8, generic, p6old, xeon74xx, xeon75xx, nehalem, xeon71xx
# If this value is set incorrectly the decoded output will be likely incorrect.
# by default when this parameter is not set mcelog uses the CPU it is running on
# on very new kernels the mcelog events reported by the kernel also carry
# the CPU type which is used too when available and not overriden.

# Enable daemon mode:
# daemon = yes
# By default mcelog just processes the currently pending events and exits.
# in daemon mode it will keep running as a daemon in the background and poll
# the kernel for events and then decode them.

# Filter out known broken events by default
filter = yes

# output in undecoded raw format to be easier machine readable
# (default is decoded)
# raw = yes

# Set CPU Mhz to decode uptime from time stamp counter (output
# unreliable, not needed on new kernels which report the event time
# directly. A lot of systems don't have a linear time stamp clock
# and the output is wrong then. 
# Normally mcelog tries to figure out if it the TSC is reliable
# and only uses the current frequency then.
# Setting a frequency forces timestamp decoding.
# cpumhz = 1800.00

# log output options
# Log decoded machine checks in syslog (default stdout or syslog for daemon)	     
# syslog = yes
# Log decoded machine checks in syslog with error level
# syslog-error = yes
# Never log anything to syslog
# no-syslog = yes     
# Append log output to logfile instead of stdout. Only when no syslog logging is active   
# logfile = filename
 
# Use SMBIOS information to decode DIMMs (needs root)
# dmi = yes
# dmi = no

# [server]
# user allowed to access client socket.
# when no user is configured any user matches (but still group checking)
# client-user = root
# group allowed to access mcelog
# when no group is configured any group matches (but still user checking)
# client-group = root
# path to the unix socket for client<->server communication
# when no socket-path is configured the server will not start
# socket-path = /var/run/mcelog-client
# when mcelog starts it checks if a server is already running. timeout
# for this check.
# initial-ping-timeout = 2 
#
# [dimm]
# Is the in memory DIMM error tracking enabled?
# Only works on systems with integrated memory controller and
# which are supported
# Only takes effect in daemon mode
# dimm-tracking-enabled = yes
# Use DMI information from the BIOS to prepopulate DIMM database
# Note this might not work with all BIOS and requires mcelog to run as root.
# Alternative is to let mcelog create DIMM objects on demand.
# dmi-prepopulate = yes
#
# execute these triggers when the rate of corrected or uncorrected
# errors per DIMM exceeds the threshold
# Note when the hardware does not report DIMMs this might also
# be per channel
# uc-error-trigger = dimm-error-trigger
# uc-error-threshold = 1 / 24h
# ce-error-trigger = dimm-error-trigger
# ce-error-threshold = 10 / 24h
#

#[cache]
#cache-threshold-trigger = cache-error-trigger

#[page]
#memory-ce-threshold = 10 / 24h
#memory-ce-trigger = page-error-trigger
# specify the internal action in mcelog to exceeding a page error threshold
# this is done in addition to executing the trigger script if available
# off      no action
# account  only account errors
# soft     try to soft-offline page without killing any processes
#          This requires an uptodate kernel. Might not be successfull.
# hard     try to hard-offline page by killing processes
#          Requires an uptodate kernel. Might not be successfull.
# soft-then-hard   First try to soft offline, then try hard offlining
#memory-ce-action = off|account|soft|hard|soft-then-hard

[trigger]
# Maximum number of running triggers
children-max = 2
# execute triggers in this directory
directory = /etc/mcelog
