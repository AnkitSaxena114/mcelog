mcelog is the user space backend for logging machine check errors
reported by the hardware to the kernel. The kernel does the immediate
actions (like killing processes etc.) and mcelog decodes the logs
the errors.

It primarily handles machine checks and thermal events, which
are reported for errors detected by the CPU.

It is recommended that mcelog runs on all x86 machines, both
64bit (since early 2.6) and 32bit (since 2.6.32)

mcelog can run in several modi: cronjob, trigger, daemon

cronjob is the old method. mcelog runs every 5 minutes from cron and checks
for errors. Disadvantage of this is that it can delay error reporting 
significantly (upto 10 minutes) and does not allow mcelog to keep extended state.

trigger is a newer method where the kernel runs mcelog on a error.
This is configured with 
echo /usr/sbin/mcelog > /sys/devices/system/machinecheck/machinecheck0/trigger
This is faster, but still doesn't allow mcelog to keep state,
and has relatively high overhead for each error because a program has
to be initialized from scratch.

In daemon mode mcelog runs continuously as a daemon in the background
and wait for errors. It is enabled by running mcelog --daemon & 
from a init script. This is the fastest.

The recommended mode is daemon, because several new functions (like page error
predictive failure analysis) require a continuously running daemon.

For distributors:

Please install a init script by default that runs mcelog in daemon mode.

/dev/mcelog is needed for mcelog operation
If it's not there it can be created with mknod /dev/mcelog c 10 227
or through udev
